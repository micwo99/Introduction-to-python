Shalom,
The principal subject of this description is the programme structure.
This concern also the repartition of the functions

For the first choice that is operate modifications on the wav file,
in the entrance menu we chose to separate all the eight options
in eight functions to conserve the clarity of the code. We also put
the all menu in a single function to be able to call
it even after the the composition of the melody as request.

For the second choice that is composition of the melody we shortened
the code by put this option in a function.
For the same reason we chose to code an auxiliary function to calculate
the sample rate.

Finally we organized all the function in a main one that we called.
